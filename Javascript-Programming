# Javascript Programming
**More about Javascript**
> can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user friendly.
> encompasses many of the traditional rules of programming.
> Ex. of javascript in browser: slideshows, forms, reload part of page, and filtering data.

- How Javascript makes web pages more interactive:
1. access content
2. modify content
3. program rules
4. react to events

**Script**
- Script: a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
- Writing a script:
1. Define the goal
2. Design the script
3. Code each step
- Designing a script:
1. Work out individual tasks needed to achieve interactive
2. Each task may be broken down to sequence pf steps
- Steps to code:
1. Define a goal & design script
2. Sketch out tasks in flowchart

**Basic Javascript Instructions**
- Expressions: evaluates into a single value
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable. Example: var color = 'beige'; --> The value of color is now beige.
2. Expressions that use 2 or more values to return a single value. Example: var area = 3 * 2; --> The value of the area is now 6.
- Operators
1. Assignment Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Arithmetic Operators
5. String Operators

- Arithmetic Operators: mathematical operators, which you can use numbers
- String Operators: the + symbol. This is used to join strings on either side. Jioning 2 or more string to create one new string is called concatenation.

**Functions**
> let you group a series of statements together to forma specific task.
- Declaring a Function: to create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside curly braces.
- Calling a function: then exclude all of the statements bewteen its curly braces with just one line of code.
- Declaring a function that need info.: sometimes a function needs specific info. to perform its task. When you declare the function you give it parameters, which act like variables.
- Calling functions that need info.: when you call a function that has parameters, specify the values it should use in parenthesis that follow its name.
1. These values are called arguments, and can be provided as value or variables. 
- Getting a single value out of a function: some functions return info. to the code that called them. Ex: when they perform a calculation, they return the result.
